## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind css

### What I learned

I learnt on Developing multisign form whereby users can be able to enter their details in a form sequentially.

```html
<picture>
  <source media="(min-width:650px)" srcset="img_pink_flowers.jpg" />
  <source media="(min-width:465px)" srcset="img_white_flower.jpg" />
  <img src="img_orange_flowers.jpg" alt="Flowers" style="width:auto;" />
</picture>
```

### Continued development

I have not fully implemented the part where user will be able to see the selected items and hover,active states.
This will be the future implementation.

### Useful resources

- [Image toggling](https://www.basedash.com/blog/how-to-change-an-image-src-with-javascript) - This helped me for learning how to toggle images using relative links and looked like dom manipulation. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [W3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox_items.asp) - I usually use this as my reference point for any code,css,html,js.

- [Grid blog](https://css-tricks.com/auto-sizing-columns-css-grid-auto-fill-vs-auto-fit/) - a blog clearly explaining the grid column auto fit layout.
